=head1 NAME

docs/readmes/README.pod - Readme file on how to convert the README files throughout the Parrot distribution into README.pod files. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This README sets out some general guidelines on how to convert the various 'README' files throughout the Parrot distribution into 'README.pod' files.  The principal reason for this effort is to provide uniform presentation throughout the distribution, and I<your> efforts will go a long-way towards helping us to achieve this objective.  So, first, please let me take a moment to say, "Thank you," both for your time and for your efforts.

The "basic" idea is to retain the text, along with the relevant headings, already present in the README file, but to wrap it all in the "proper" pod format.  To accomplish this, please use the 'README_template.pod', included in this directory, as your guide.  For a specific example of a "properly" formatted 'README.pod' file, please I<see> the 'README.pod' file in the 'docs/readmes/parrot/' directory.  And, to learn more about the pod markup language, please I<see> 'perlpod' (I<i.e.,> issue the command, C<perldoc perlpod> in your favorite shell or commandline program, assuming, of course, you already have Perl installed on your system.  (If not, please I<see> the main './README.pod' for information on which version of Perl you need to install.)

To "properly" mark-up the 'README' files with pod, please use the below guidepost,

=item * A copy of each of the relevant 'README' files, contained in the Parrot distribution, is already in a directory within the 'docs/readmes/parrot' directory structure.  Simply navigate to the directory which contains the 'README' file to which you have been assigned (or on which you have agreed to work); make a copy of the 'README'; rename it to 'README.pod'; open the 'README.pod' in your favorite editor; and begin your edits.

=item * 

=item * The first line of the file must contain a commented statement of copyright I<e.g.,> '# Copyright (C) [year]-[year], Parrot Foundation'.  Please note, if the 'README' file does not include a statement of copyright or does not set out a range of years, then please add the statement and use the present year as the year of copyright.

=item * Ensure all headings contain the proper pod command, I<e.g.,> '=head1' or '=head2'.  Also, please remove any characters or sequence of characters, I<e.g.,> '----------', which serve to delimit or demarcate a heading.  The pod commands sufficiently serve this purpose.

=item * Ensure the following is the last heading command and the last line of text of the file,

NOTE - A note list file for Parrot's Documentation Revision Effort.

This document contains several relevant notes about the documentation revision
effort. 

01. The directory in which this 'NOTE' file is contained, i.e., 'revisions',
    serves, essentially, as the base directory for the documentation revision
    effort.  Or, in other words, the 'revisions' directory is kind'a/sort'a
    the logical equivalent of the 'docs' directory in the parrot repo.

    The reason for this is, it provides us with a "base" directory from which to
    maintain some parity with parrot's 'docs' directory, but, also, provides us
    with a place to put the documentation files on which we are working or have
    completed. In fact, 'revisions', itself, contains a 'docs' directory, which
    mirrors parrot's on 'docs' structure; though, of course, not all of the
    documents in parrot's 'docs' directory will appear in revisions' 'docs'
    directory, but many will. --acy

=head1 NAME

docs/mans/vmspec/preface.pod - Preface to the Parrot Virtual Machine 
Specification. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Parrot Virtual Machine Specification [hereinafter PVM Spec] is an effort
to document, fully, the design of the Parrot Virtual Machine [hereinafter PVM].  
It is an essential guide for compiler writers wanting to target the PVM.  It
is also the definitive source of documentation for anyone who wants to 
understand the PVM implementation.

As with any virtual machine, the Parrot Virtual Machine [hereinafter PVM] is, 
necessarily, an abstract machine.  But, unlike other specifications, this 
specification refers exclusively to the concrete implementation of the Parrot 
Community, a copy of which is available at the main project website.[1]

Please send any comments about this specification or questions about Parrot to 
'parrot-dev@lists.parrot.org'.  You may subscribe to the mailing list by 
filling out the form at http://lists.parrot.org/mailman/listinfo/parrot-users.
There is also an archive of the mailing list at 
http://lists.parrot.org/pipermail/parrot-users/. You may also visit with many 
of the Parrot developers on channel #parrot on the IRC server irc.parrot.org. 
Alternative IRC servers are irc.rhizomatic.net and irc.pobox.com.

=head1 NAME

docs/mans/vmspec/README.pod - Readme file to the Parrot Virtual Machine 
Specification. 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This README sets out a brief overview of the Parrot Virtual Machine 
Specification.  The purpose of this virtual machine specification is to 
document, clearly, the design of the Parrot virtual machine.  The goals 
of this specification are two-fold:

=over 4

=item * to serve as a reference document for for compiler writers, who wish to 
target the virtual machine, and 

=item * to serve as the definitive source of documentation on the implementation
of a virtual machine.

=back

In order to accomplish these goals, this specification also includes something 
akin to an implementation reference.  That is to say, this specification 
includes -- where appropriate or useful to further elucidate the material under
consideration -- implementation details, to include specific code examples.  
As examples, where this specification addresses certain aspects of Parrot's 
internal structure, it will include relevant snippets of 'C' code with which 
to elucidate the material and where it covers the issue of how to load parrot 
bytecode, it will also include specific code examples, in the 'Winxed' 
programming language, on how to accomplish this feat.

=head2 Organization

Roughly, though subject to revision, the organization of this specification 
is as follows:

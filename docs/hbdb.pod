=head1 NAME

docs/hbdb.pod - The Honey Bee Debugger

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    hbdb [options] [file]    

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Honey Bee Debugger (HBDB) is the standard debugger for the Parrot virtual
machine.

The purpose of a debugger is to allow programmer's to examine and modify what
is happening as their program executes from within an interactive environment.
This introduces some pretty convenient operations such as:

=over 4

=item *

Forcing a program to stop at a specific point or under certain conditions.

=item *

Inspecting variables and registers during a specific state.

=item *

Stepping through source code line by line.

=item *

Performing a backtrace to track a sequence of function calls.

=back

Already, it is easy to see just how valuable a debugger really is during
software development.

In its current state, HBDB is only capable of debugging programs written in
PIR. In the near future, any high level language using the Parrot Compiler
Tools (PCT) will be supported.

You will notice a lot of similarities with the GNU Project's GDB. This was done
intentionally to make users of HBDB more comfortable.

=head1 OPTIONS

Command-line switches come in two flavors: short and long. Like many other
GNU/Linux utilities, the short form uses a hyphen and single letter (e.g. C<-a>)
while the long form uses a double hyphen and a keyword (e.g. C<--foobar>).
However, switches I<can not> be grouped together. For instance, if you wish to
use both the C<-a> and C<-b> switches, you can not type C<-ab>. In this case,
only the first switch is applied and the second is ignored.

=over 4

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Displays help information.

=item B<-l>, B<--license>

Displays license information.

=back

=head1 COMMANDS

HBDB understands the following commands:

=over 4

=item B<help>, B<h>

Displays a summary help message.

=item B<list>, B<l>

Display lines from the source file being debugged.

=item B<quit>, B<q>

Exits HBDB.

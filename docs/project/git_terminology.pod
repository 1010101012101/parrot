docs/project/git_terminology.pod - Git Terminology

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes terms that are used in F<docs/project/git_workflow.pod>
and contains generally useful things to know about Git.


=head1 INTRODUCTION

Before learning any terminology, there are a few very basic things that
should be understood about Git, which will provide a foundation for
understanding anything else.

A Git repository is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each node in the
graph is a commit, with zero or more parents. The first commit of a
repository has zero parents, others have at least one parent. If a commit has
more than one parent, that means it was the result of a merge.

Each commit is uniquely identified by a SHA1 sum. You may refer to any commit
by the first few characters of a SHA1 sum, as long as it is unique. If it is
not unique, C<git> will complain loudly. Usually 6-7 characters of a SHA1 is
sufficient, but this number increases as the number of commits in a repo
grows.

There are three distinct "places" in a Git repository, which are referred to
as the index, the working copy, and the staging area. The index is the actual
DAG, where all the history of the repo is stored. This lives in the .git
directory of a repository. The "working copy" are the actual files on the
filesystem. The staging area is where things that will be included in the
next commit live. When you type C<git add foo>, you are adding the
file/directory foo to the staging area. When you type C<git log> you are
asking the index to show you a log of all commits. When you run a non-git
command in a repo, such as C<rm foo>, you are modifying the working copy.

The most important thing to learn when understanding a C<git> command is whether
it operates on the index, working copy, staging area or a combination of the
three. Also note that certain C<git> commands can operate on different areas
when given different command-line options.

=head1 TERMS

=head2 clone

=head2 remote

=head2 INTRODUCTION

Before learning any terminology, there are a few very basic things that
should be understood about Git, which will provide a foundation for
understanding anything else.

A Git repository is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), where each node in the
graph is a commit, with zero or more parents. The first commit of a
repository has zero parents, others have at least one parent. If a commit has
more than one parent, that means it was the result of a merge.

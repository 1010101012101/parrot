  eligible: 2.7
  note: 'Currently, if no :main sub is found, the first .sub in a file is used as main. Also, arguments are passed to the main sub regardless of the .param declarations in that sub. After this change, if no sub is marked with :main, an exception will be raised. Multiple :main declarations will be still be allowed, and all but the first will be ignored. This change will also force all subs, including :main, to have their arguments checked - to allow an arbitrary number of arguments, have this be the only .param declaration in the sub.'

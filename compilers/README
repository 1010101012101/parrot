== NAME ==

compilers - various compilers used by Parrot

== DESCRIPTION ==

The 'compilers' directory contains the source files for several compilers that
are used by Parrot such as IMCC and PGE. For more detailed information on
these, please see their respective README files in the subdirectories listed
below.

== SUBDIRECTORIES ==

* data_json

Source files for the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) compiler. Used when
generating a JSON representation of a PMC.

* imcc

Source files for the Intermediate Code Compiler (IMCC). Translates PIR files
into Parrot bytecode.

* opsc

Source files for the opcode compiler (a.k.a. ops2c). Converts opcode definition
files into C code.

* pct

Source files for the compiler used by the Parrot Compiler Toolkit (PCT).

* pge

Source files for the compiler used by the Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE). This is
an implementation of Perl 6 regexes.

* tge

Source files for the compiler used by the Tree Grammer Engine (TGE). This is the
tool used to transform the trees output by the PGE into a Parrot Abstract
Syntax Tree (PAST).

== NAME ==

config - modules used by the configuration process

== DESCRIPTION ==

The 'config' directory contains all the Perl 5 modules that are used by
Configure.pl during the configuration process. They are split into
several subdirectories (listed below) based upon their package name.

== SUBDIRECTORIES ==

* auto

Modules that perform system probes for determining CPU architecture, OS, C
compiler, installed packages, etc.

* gen

Modules for generating files based on the platform-specific data collected by
the auto::* modules. This includes the Makefile, header files, core PMC's,
etc.

* init

Modules for setting up the install path, platform hints, manifest checking,
optimizations, etc.

* inter

Modules for "interrupting" the user (if --ask was given to Configure.pl)
to set certain configurations by hand such as what compiler, linker, C
libraries, lexer/parser should be used, whether debugging should be enabled,
what flavor of make is installed, etc.

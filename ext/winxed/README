This is a snapshot of winxed compiler and driver.

The pir files are generated from the winxed repository, copied here,
and compiled to pbc during the parrot build.

How to update the snapshot:

- Download and build the winxed release wanted.

- Execute 'make preinstall' to generate the pir files used.

- Copy pir/winxed_compiler.pir and pir/winxed_installed.pir from
the winxed build tree to compiler.pir and driver.pir in this
directory.

How to choose and tag the release used.

- This will be added after the migration of winxed to a git repository.

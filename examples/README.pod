=head1 NAME

    examples/ - helpful examples of common tasks with Parrot

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<examples> directory provides examples of some of the more common - and
sometimes hillarious - uses of the Parrot virtual machine. If you are new to
the world of Parrot, browsing through some of these examples can be incredibly
helpful. Most of these examples are tested by the test files in C<t/examples>.

=head1 SUBDIRECTORIES

=over 4

=item C<benchmarks>

Benchmark test examples. They can be run with C<make benchmark_tests>.
     
=item C<c>

Examples in C that demonstrate the embedding API and how the Parrot frontend
interprets bytecode.

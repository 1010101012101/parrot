== NAME ==

examples - helpful examples of common tasks with Parrot

== DESCRIPTION ==

The 'examples' directory provides examples of some of the more common - and
sometimes hillarious - uses of the Parrot virtual machine. If you are new to
the world of Parrot, browsing through some of these examples can be incredibly
helpful. Most of these examples are tested by the test files in 't/examples'.

== SUBDIRECTORIES ==

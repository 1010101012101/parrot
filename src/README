== NAME ==

src - source files used for Parrot internals

== DESCRIPTION ==

The 'src' directory contains the source files that make up the virtual machine
and its various subsystems. It mostly contains C code, PMC definitions, and
opcode definitions.

== SUBDIRECTORIES ==

* atomic

Implementations of atomic operations on x86 and SPARC platforms.

* call

The Parrot Calling Conventions (PCC) for handling arguments and return values
for subroutines.

* dynoplibs

Source files for creating dynamic opcode libraries that are loaded at runtime.

* dynpmc

Source files for creating dynamic PMC's that are loaded at runtime.

* embed

The Parrot embedding API. This is used for embedding a Parrot interpreter
in third-party applications.

* gc

Source files that make up Parrot's garbage collection system and its public API.

* interp

Source files related to the interpreter such as callback handling, creation and
destruction, compiler registration, etc.

Parrot's IO subsystem and its public API.

* nci

The Native Call Interface for calling C code from PIR.

* ops

Core opcode definitions.

* packfile
